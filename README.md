# Visual Sorts
> A web app that visualises sorting algorithms.

### Visit this web app at [github.talhaak.com/visual-sorts](https://github.talhaak.com/visual-sorts/)

This web app visualises several different sorting algorithms to help build a better understanding on how they function.

The site was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) (with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

This is a first-time project using both these technologies.

Some other notable modules used were:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as the CSS framework
- [@headlessui/react](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/tree/main/packages/%40headlessui-react) for a few components
- [react-icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons) for the icons
